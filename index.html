    <h1>Weird-ass controllers</h1>
    <p>The game supports multiple controllers but the weirder ones where made by Namco itself...</p>
    <h2>NEGCON</h2>
    <p>
        Released in 1995 as a way to accurately control cars in Namco's racing games.<br>
        The controller is separated in two halves by a swivel-joint which allows the player to twist them. That movement
        is registered to make the cars turn left or right<br>
        Also the L and R buttons as well as Square and X (Labeled I and II) are analog buttons allowing for more finer
        control of the accelerator and brake.<br>
        It has support for most of the racing games on the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeGcon#Supported_games">PS1 Library </a>
        Weirdly enough it's <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.co.jp/cs/list/negcon/index.php">official webpage is
            still up </a>
    </p>
    <h2>JOGCON</h2>
    <p>
        Parallel to developing this game, Namco released a new controller with it.<br>
        The dial in the middle uses motors to provide force feedback, but it's hard to reach and in my experience
        sometimes stops giving feedback altogether.<br>
        It was sold as a bundle with the game as well as separate.<br>
        In the end it didn't do great as evidenced by it only being supported fully in 5 games:
    <ul>
        <li>Ridge Racer Type 4</li>
        <li>V-Rally 2</li>
        <li>Pac-Man World</li>
        <li>Breakout</li>
        <li>Ridge Racer V</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>These two controllers are valuable in a speedrun setting because you don't lose as much speed while turning</p>

    <h1>Did you know it's a game made by namco?</h1>
    <p>All of the in-world brands,sponsors and teams are named after Namco properties.<br>
        Let's see how many you can spot!
    </p>

    <h1>Game releases</h1>
    <h2>JOGCON bundle</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>HI-Spec Demo</h2>
    <p>
        The original release includes a playable demo of Ridge Racer 1 running at 60 fps (50 on PAL land) as a way to
        show how far acquainted they've become with the hardware and as a statement for future games.
    </p>
    <h1>PocketStation support</h1>
    <p>
        The pocketstation game allowed you to see which cars you had unlocked as well as trade them with other
        players.<br>
        It's no Chocobo World
    </p>

    <h1>Rocket Start</h1>
    <p>
        It's a technique available when using a car with Manual Transmission(MT)<br>
        On the start countdown hold down the accelerator and shift up to the last gear while keeping the revs between 6k
        and 7k,
        the last shift should coincide with the race starting.<br>
        You'll get a boost to the max speed of the car and see the 8th and 7th car rubberbanding like crazy.
    </p>
    <h1>Motion blur</h1>
    <p>On replays press Triangle to activate motion blur</p>
    <h1>Racing An Eagle</h1>
    <p>
        In Grand Prix, On Crimsonrock Pass and during countdown at the beginning of the race press Left, Right 3 times
    </p>

    <h1>The case of the many Reikos</h1>
    <p>
        First introduced in the attract mode of Rave Racer(1995), Reiko Nagase became a mainstay of the series.
        The success of Type 4 spawned a bunch of Reiko look alikes in other Namco series, mainly:

    - Rena Hirose
    - Rena Hayami (Ace combat 3)
    - Kei Nagase (Ace combat 2/5/7)

    <h1>Old website</h1>
    <p>For some reason Namco still hosted the 1998 website until 2021.
        It since has been preserved (with emulated flash) at https://www.omamoka.com/ridge4/</p>
